# Information-Retrieval-System
An information retrieval system that uses lnc.ltc (SMART) notation on vector space based model to retrieve relevant documents.
- "Main" folder contains implementation of vector space based model for IR
- "Improvement 1" is the implementation of lnc.ltc with spell check in query and lemmatization for better results
- "Improvement 2" is the implementation of Latent Semantic Indexing for even better results
- The dataset is "wiki_01txt.txt"
- The IR system can be tested using "test_queries.py" present in each folder
- The .npy files in the folders are intermediate data structures formed for faster computation
- The results are shown in the "Report"
